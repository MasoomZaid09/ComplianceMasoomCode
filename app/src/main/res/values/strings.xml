            ("we", "us", "our" or "PMI") and you ("you" , "your" or "User") governs your use of the www.pmi.org web site ("Site")
            together with all information, content, products, materials and services made available to you through the same by us and/or
            third parties (which together with the Site shall be collectively referred to as the "Services"). By using or otherwise
            accessing the Services, or any component thereof, in any manner whatsoever, you agree to be bound by and comply with the terms
            and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do not access or use the Services in any manner.
            When we refer to the "use" of the Services in this Agreement, we mean any actual or attempted access or use of the Services,
            including, without limitation, any transmission, exchange of information or communication associated with the Services.
            These terms and conditions, together with the other terms of use applicable to other PMI-owned or controlled web sites and
            any other policies, rules and provisions which are described, linked or otherwise referred to and form a part of this Agreement,
            including, without limitation our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any and all
            prior or inconsistent understandings, representations or agreements regarding the Services. PMI reserves the right to modify the
            terms of this Agreement at any time, and will post a notice of such changes. The changes become effective immediately upon posting
            (the "Effective Date"). If any change to the Agreement is not acceptable to you, you must stop using the Services. Your use of the
            Services after the Effective Date shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. If we make any new products or services
            available, they will be considered a part of the Services and your use of them will be governed by the terms and conditions of
            this Agreement unless we notify you that different terms and conditions apply. You must also comply with any additional terms
            which apply to third-party content, material, information, software or other services.
